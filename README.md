# iPhone Sales Forecasting for 2024
iPhone revenue forecasts for 2024. In this project i have produce forecasts for the next 4-quarters for Apple’s iPhone revenue, which will be included in the company’s quarterly earnings presentation. 

I am provided with history of iPhone revenue, iPhone units, and iPhone releases. I need to produce forecasts for each quarter of 2024. 

I need to also model the quarterly unit volume to estimate missing values, as your team accidentally deleted the file with the recent data. Average selling price will need to be estimated based on your estimate for the unit volume (average selling price = sales / units).

I need to produce what you believe are your best forecasts. My best model may be a unidirectional model, or a regression model that uses your unit or sales price estimates. You will need to defend your methodology.

Additionally, I must also produce forecasts assuming: <br>
(1) a 10% decline in average selling price<br>
(2) a 10% increase in average selling price in order to give the market scenarios.
